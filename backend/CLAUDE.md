# CLAUDE.md — Flux Calculation backend

Standing instructions for the **Python + FastAPI backend**. Read this alongside the
root [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) (cross-app picture and engineering rules) and
[`../project-brief.md`](../project-brief.md) (the product spec — the source of truth
for behaviour, data, and edge cases).

The backend ingests raw closed-chamber greenhouse-gas files — concentration, time
notes, and temperature are required; the IMGW **pressure file is optional** (when
absent the flux math falls back to a default sea-level pressure, and every affected
spot is flagged `no_pressure`). It matches them by
timestamp, fits a linear regression per gas per spot, and computes CO₂/CH₄ flux
across a full unit ladder. **The flux math is pure code and never LLM-touched;** the
LLM only normalises messy input formats, and its output is always human-confirmed.

## Tech stack
- **Python 3.14**, **FastAPI** served with **uvicorn**.
- Data/math: **pandas**, **numpy**, **scipy** (`scipy.stats.linregress` for slope + R²).
- Files: **openpyxl** (xlsx), **python-docx** (Word notes).
- DB: **SQLite** via **SQLModel** (SQLAlchemy under the hood) — one file per install.
- Config: **pydantic-settings** (`app/core/config.py`, loads `.env`).
- Uploads: **python-multipart** (FastAPI file uploads).
- Tests: **pytest** (+ **httpx** / FastAPI `TestClient`).
- Lint/format + types: **ruff** (lint *and* format) and **mypy** (strict).
- Deps live in **`pyproject.toml`** (hatchling build), installed into a **venv**.

## How to run
From `backend/`:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"        # runtime + dev deps
cp .env.example .env           # then edit as needed; .env is git-ignored
uvicorn app.main:app --reload  # serves on http://localhost:8000
```
Health check (used by tests and ops):
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health   # -> {"status":"ok","app":"Flux Calculation API"}
```
CORS is preconfigured for the Vite dev server (`http://localhost:5173`); adjust
`CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env` if the frontend runs elsewhere.

## How to test / lint
From `backend/`, with the venv active:
```bash
pytest                    # run the suite (config in pyproject: testpaths=tests, -q)
ruff check .              # lint
ruff format --check .     # formatting (drop --check to apply)
mypy .                    # strict type-check (files = ["app"])
```
All four must be **green before every commit** (root rule 2). Write or update a
**failing test first**, then the code to pass it (root rule 1). `pytest` discovers
tests recursively: the flat `tests/*.py` (unit + API integration) plus
`tests/security/` (security baseline). `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` are
placeholders mirroring the target layout — see `tests/README.md`. CI runs the whole
suite + ruff + mypy (`.github/workflows/test.yml`); checkov scans the Dockerfile.

## API structure
- **Route prefix:** everything the frontend calls lives under **`/api`** (e.g.
  `/api/health`, later `/api/analyses`, `/api/results`).
- **Routers** live in **`app/api/`** — one module per resource area (upload,
  analyses, results, webhooks). Wire each router into the app in **`app/main.py`**
  via `app.include_router(...)`.
- **Request/response models** are Pydantic models in **`app/schemas/`**. Routers
  speak schemas, not raw dicts or ORM rows.
- **Pure logic stays out of routers.** Parsing, matching, and flux math live in
  `app/parsing/`, `app/matching/`, `app/flux/` as plain, testable functions;
  routers orchestrate and translate to/from schemas.
- **Errors** use `app/api/errors.py:api_error(...)` → body
  `{"detail": {code, message, field?}}` so the frontend rebuilds its
  `ApiError { code, field }`.

**Endpoints so far:**
- `GET /api/health` — liveness.
- `POST /api/analyses` — multipart (`name, work_date, chamber_area_m2,
  chamber_volume_l, time_offset_seconds` + files `concentration, notes,
  temperature` required, `pressure` **optional**). 422 `missing_file` (only for a
  missing *required* file)/`bad_li7810`, 409 `duplicate_name`; on success stores the
  uploaded files, creates the `Analysis` (status `needs_review`), and parses notes
  into unconfirmed `Spot` rows.
- `PUT /api/analyses/{id}` — edit an existing analysis (the "change files / re-run"
  flow). Same multipart shape as create, but **all files optional**: only uploaded
  files are replaced (old file for that role removed first), the rest kept; a
  replaced concentration is re-validated as LI-7810; rename collisions 409. Replacing
  inputs resets status to `needs_review` and clears prior `Reading`/`FluxResult`/log
  rows (re-confirm + re-match); if the notes file was replaced the `Spot` set is
  rebuilt from it. 404 if unknown.
- `GET /api/analyses` — summaries, newest first. `GET /api/analyses/{id}` — one
  (404). `DELETE /api/analyses/{id}` — removes the analysis, its children, and its
  stored files (204).
- `GET /api/analyses/{id}/notes` → `ParsedNotes` (Spot rows with freshly computed
  `NoteFlag`s; `parse_failed` always False for now — `# TODO: LLM fallback`).
  `PUT /api/analyses/{id}/notes` (body: `NoteRow[]`) replaces the spot set with the
  confirmed/edited rows, re-validates, and returns the saved `ParsedNotes` (404 if
  the analysis is missing).
- `POST /api/analyses/{id}/match` — the pipeline core: parse stored files → apply
  offset → per-spot slice + attach temp/pressure → fit both gases → persist
  `Reading` + `FluxResult` + `ProcessingLogEntry` → status `complete`. Skips
  empty-window / stop-before-start spots (logged). **Pressure is optional**: with no
  pressure file (or no reading near a spot) the flux uses
  `constants.DEFAULT_PRESSURE_HPA` (1013.25 hPa = 1 atm) and the spot is
  flagged/logged `no_pressure`; temperature is still required to compute a spot. An
  unreadable stored file returns a clean **422** (`bad_concentration`/
  `bad_temperature`/`bad_pressure`) on the right field rather than a 500.
  **Idempotent**: clears the previous run's rows first. Returns a `MatchSummary`. The
  router is thin — all math is in `flux/` + `matching/`. **The matching date comes
  from the concentration file's own `DATE`, not the form's `work_date`** (a wrong
  hand-typed date would otherwise put every window on the wrong day → all empty);
  the analysis's `work_date` is corrected to the data's date.
- `GET /api/analyses/{id}/results?fit_mode=auto|full` → `ResultsPayload`
  (per-spot table; flags
  `low_r2`/`short_window`/`dropped_nan`/`no_pressure`; skipped spots carry a
  `skip_reason`). **`fit_mode`** (default `auto`; `full` blocks automatic window
  fitting → whole-recording flux for every spot; 422 `bad_fit_mode` otherwise).
  `quality_check.available` is **false** with a pending message —
  n8n is deferred (`# TODO: n8n quality check`).
- `GET /api/analyses/{id}/spots/{nr}?fit_mode=auto|full` → `SpotDetail` (per-gas
  points with `in_window`, fit incl. `n_dropped_nan` + `n_spikes`, `fit_window`,
  flux ladder, **plus `context`** — a faint wider raw record `SPOT_CONTEXT_EXTRA_SECONDS`
  before/after the stored window, re-parsed from the LI file, display-only, so the
  manual-shift control has visible surroundings) plus the fit meta `mode`,
  `fit_offset_s`, `fit_window_s`, `window_shortened`. **`fit_mode`** (default `auto`) selects the best/shortened
  window; **`full`** fits the whole recorded window as-is (no window search) — the
  "use the file's time series without fitting" view. A saved manual offset on the
  spot overrides both (`mode="manual"`). `null` for a skipped spot, 404 if the spot
  doesn't exist, 422 (`bad_fit_mode`) on an unknown `fit_mode`.
- `GET /api/analyses/{id}/temperature` → `TemperatureSummary` — the **parsed
  temperature review** backing the confirm-temperature page: `available`, `count`,
  `start_unix`/`end_unix`, `min_c`/`max_c`/`mean_c`, and a **downsampled preview
  series** (`points`, capped like the overview background). `available=false` with a
  `message` when no temperature file is stored or it can't be read (so the UI points
  the user back to Upload instead of failing at match time). 404 if the analysis is
  unknown.
- `PUT /api/analyses/{id}/spots/{nr}/fit` (body `SpotFitUpdate` =
  `{offset_s: float | null, end_offset_s?: float | null}`) — set (or clear with
  `offset_s=null`) a spot's **manual fit window**: the per-spot correction for a
  mis-placed automatic window. `offset_s` is **relative to the recorded start** —
  positive = later, **negative = earlier** (moves the window into the lead margin of
  data before the recorded start). The optional **`end_offset_s`** crops the far edge
  too (both ends chosen by hand, for spots disturbed at both ends); omit it to keep
  the default window length (a plain shift). `end_offset_s <= offset_s` → 422
  `bad_window`. Persists `Spot.manual_offset_s`/`manual_end_offset_s`, **rewrites that
  spot's `FluxResult`** so the results table and export follow, logs the change, and
  returns the recomputed `SpotDetail`. 404 if the spot doesn't exist. Manual windows
  survive a re-`match` **and a re-confirm of unchanged notes** (`PUT …/notes` carries
  `manual_offset_s`/`manual_end_offset_s` forward for rows whose `nr`+times are
  unchanged; a changed row resets its window). So adding a pressure file later
  changes only the results, not the hand-picked windows.
- `GET /api/analyses/{id}/timeseries?fit_mode=auto|full` → `Timeseries` (per gas:
  every computed spot's points on the absolute time axis with `in_window`, the
  fit-line endpoints, **and `background`** — the rest of the raw concentration
  record not assigned to any spot, re-parsed from the stored LI-7810 file with the
  analysis offset applied, so the overview graph shows the **complete** record —
  **uniformly downsampled to `TIMESERIES_MAX_BACKGROUND_POINTS`** so a long campaign
  doesn't make Plotly stutter. A missing/unreadable stored file degrades to an empty
  `background`). 422 (`bad_fit_mode`) on an unknown `fit_mode`.
- `GET /api/analyses/{id}/log` → the `ProcessingLogEntry` rows in order.
- Read endpoints recompute per-spot fits from the persisted `Reading` rows via the
  same `fit_spot` pipeline (one code path); `FluxResult` stays the durable record
  the export reads.
- `GET /api/analyses/{id}/export?format=xlsx|txt|csv` (default `xlsx`, 422 on
  unknown, 404 on unknown analysis) — streams a download with the identity columns
  + conditions + **full unit ladder per gas**, built from `FluxResult` by the
  reusable `app/export/tabular.py:build_table`. `Content-Disposition` uses the
  analysis name.

**Pipeline overview** (the end-to-end flow the endpoints assemble):
```
upload → parse notes (LLM, seminar 6) → confirm (human edits) → match by timestamp
       → fit slope + compute flux (pure code) → results / processing log / export
```

## Layout (`app/`)
```
main.py       FastAPI entry + route wiring; /api/health lives here for now
api/          routers (one module per resource area)
core/         config/settings (config.py), logging (logging.py + middleware.py),
              monitoring (monitoring.py — Sentry), chamber-constant defaults
parsing/      LI-7810, temperature, notes, pressure loaders (pure)
llm/          notes/pressure parser — prompt + schema + validation (TODO: seminar 6)
matching/     time-shift + auto-match by timestamp (pure)
flux/         regression + closed-chamber flux + unit ladder (pure)
db/           SQLModel models, session, migrations
schemas/      Pydantic request/response models
```
`tests/` mirrors this layout. `sample_data/` holds small, realistic parser
fixtures (`li7810_sample.txt`, `temperature_sample.xlsx`, …) used by tests and the
demo; `sample_data/generate_samples.py` regenerates them deterministically. The
`parsing/` modules are pure functions (no FastAPI): `li7810.py` (`parse_li7810`,
`looks_like_li7810`), `temperature.py` (`parse_temperature`), `notes.py`
(`parse_notes` + `validate_notes` producing the `NoteFlag`s; CSV/XLSX/DOCX, English
+ simple Polish headers), and `pressure.py` (`parse_pressure`, hPa). The
notes/pressure parsers are deterministic and cover well-formed files only; tolerant
parsing of messy notes is the deferred LLM feature (`# TODO ... seminar 6`).

**Real-export robustness (all times treated as naive local wall-clock):**
- `tabular.py` (shared) centralises the tolerant reading used by the temperature
  **and** pressure parsers: `read_table` (xlsx/csv/txt, wrong-extension fallback,
  encoding + delimiter sniffing, clean `ValueError` on legacy `.xls`),
  `resolve_temporal_columns` + `to_unix_seconds` (date/time in **one or two**
  columns, unix-seconds passthrough, day/month/year order inferred from the
  values), and **`to_float_series`** — numeric coercion that tolerates
  **European comma decimals** (`13,35` → 13.35) and thousands commas
  (`1,013.25`), used by temperature, pressure, **and** the LI-7810 gases. A
  comma-decimal file used to coerce to all-NaN silently; it now parses.
- `li7810.py` locates the `SECONDS/CO2/CH4` header anywhere in the metadata
  preamble (handles LI-COR `DATAH`/`DATAU`/`DATA` markers, case-insensitive). **The
  matching timeline is built from the local `DATE`+`TIME` columns when present**, not
  the `SECONDS` column — real exports put true-unix in `SECONDS` (a different
  timezone from the field notes), so using it would misalign matching by the UTC
  offset. Falls back to `SECONDS` only when DATE/TIME are absent (or when Excel
  re-cast the DATE/TIME cells so none parse). **The DATE format is chosen by
  separator:** dotted `DD.MM.YYYY` (European, e.g. `06.10.2025` = 6 October) is
  parsed **day-first** to match the temperature loader; dashed `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO)
  is year-first (forcing day-first on ISO makes pandas flip it to the wrong
  month).
  - **Encoding + Excel tolerance:** the text reader sniffs the encoding via the
    shared `parsing/encoding.py` (`utf-8-sig`, then Polish Windows `cp1250`, then
    `latin-1`, and honours a UTF-16 BOM) — so a Windows
    export with non-ASCII preamble bytes (`°C`, a Polish site name) or a legacy
    code page no longer raises `UnicodeDecodeError` and gets wrongly rejected as
    "not a LI-7810 export"; the header/columns/numbers we use are ASCII, so any
    encoding decodes them identically. Both `looks_like_li7810` and `parse_li7810`
    also accept the same layout saved as **`.xlsx`/`.xlsm`** (openpyxl; sniffed by
    suffix or ZIP magic) — the "open the .txt in Excel and Save As" file — reading
    it header-less, finding the header row by name, and re-keying the data. Legacy
    `.xls` is not supported (no `xlrd` dependency). The frontend concentration
    dropzone accepts `.txt,.xlsx,.xlsm` accordingly.
- `temperature.py` reads `.xlsx`/`.csv`/`.txt` via the shared `tabular.py` and is
  **format-agnostic** — it resolves which column is which by name *and* by content,
  so a new logger export doesn't need a code change. `tabular.read_table` **locates
  the header row** (skipping a preamble line above it, e.g. `MeterID  0x03423E62`, by
  finding the first row that names a date/time column) and **tolerates ragged rows**
  (`on_bad_lines="skip"`), so real logger exports with marker rows like
  `Measurement_Start`/`Measurement_Stop` (no temperature) parse cleanly — those rows
  are dropped for want of a value. Encoding sniffed via `parsing/encoding.py` (a
  cp1250 `°C` no longer rejects the file). Delimiters: tab/`;`/`,` plus a **2+-space**
  fallback for space-aligned/fixed-width exports (keeps the single space inside a
  `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` datetime intact). Temperature column: exact aliases, then any
  header containing `temp`/`°C`/`(c)` (ignoring extra Status/Type/CO2/RH columns);
  values coerced via `to_float_series` so **comma decimals** (`13,35`) work. Date/time
  may be in **one combined column** or **two separate columns** (English
  `Date`/`Time`, Polish `Data`+`Godzina`/`Czas`) — separate columns are recombined,
  and an Excel date-only cell's `00:00:00` tail is stripped so a separate time
  attaches. The **day/month/year order is inferred from the values**: a 4-digit
  leading part → ISO year-first (`2025-10-06`); a part > 12 → fixes the day (day-first
  `13.10.2025`) or the month (US `10/13/2025`); ambiguous → European day-first. When
  headers are unrecognised it falls back to the column that parses as the most
  datetimes. Unreadable / no date / no temp column → clean `ValueError` (→ 422).
- `notes.py` sniffs the **encoding** (shared `parsing/encoding.py`:
  utf-8-sig/cp1250/latin-1 + UTF-16 BOM — a cp1250 site name like `nad tamą` no
  longer rejects the file) and auto-detects the delimiter for `.csv`/`.txt`/`.tsv`
  (tab/`;`/`,`, plus a **2+-space** fallback for space-aligned exports so verbose
  headers/values keep their single internal spaces). Columns are resolved **intelligently** by
  `_FIELD_MATCHERS` — an exact whole-header token *and* a substring keyword, in
  English + simple Polish — so verbose real headers resolve without a hard-coded
  alias: `Start`/`End` (start/stop), `Light or Dark`/`Chamber`/`Komora`
  (light/dark), `GPS`, `Punkt`/`Pkt`/`numer` (number), `Gdzie`/`Other site
  Info`/`comment`/`uwagi` (location). Unrelated columns (`Date`,
  `Type Of Measurement` — only an exact `type` maps to light/dark —, `TEMPERATURA`)
  are ignored; each header is claimed once, in priority order, so specific fields
  win over the broad location keywords. Header whitespace/newlines are stripped
  first (a Word table may wrap `Light/dark` as `"Light\n/dark"`); a bare `?` GPS
  counts as missing.
  Spot `nr` is renumbered 1..N when the file's numbers are absent/zero or collide
  (e.g. a `4` and a `4.5` light/dark pair). All note/temperature times are read as
  naive wall-clock so they line up with the LI-7810 DATE/TIME. Legacy `.xls` is
  rejected with a clear message (openpyxl can't read it; no `xlrd` dependency).
- `pressure.py` (optional IMGW file) is built on the shared `tabular.py`, so it
  has the **same tolerance as temperature**: `.csv`/`.txt`/`.xlsx`, cp1250/UTF-16
  encodings, tab/`;`/`,`/2-space delimiters, **comma decimals**, unix-seconds
  **or** datetime timestamps in **one or two** columns, and day/month/year order
  inferred from the values. The pressure column is resolved by exact alias
  (`pressure`/`hpa`/`cisnienie`/`ciśnienie`/…) then a substring keyword. Values
  are hPa unless `assume_unit` says otherwise (kPa/Pa/mbar). A truly free-form,
  header-less IMGW export is still deferred to the LLM (`# TODO seminar 6`). The
  frontend pressure dropzone now advertises `.csv,.txt,.tsv,.xlsx` (was "any
  format", which let people drop files the backend then rejected).
- **Silent-drop logging:** `parse_li7810` records, on `df.attrs`, how many
  readings it invalidated per reason (`n_diag_invalid` = red-DIAG rows,
  `n_co2_out_of_range`/`n_ch4_out_of_range` = values outside the plausible
  ranges); the match endpoint (`_drop_log_messages`) turns each non-zero count
  into a processing-log line, so drops that used to vanish are now visible. The
  CO₂ upper plausibility bound is **configurable** — `settings.max_valid_co2_ppm`
  (env `MAX_VALID_CO2_PPM`, default **5000** ppm), threaded in as
  `parse_li7810(max_co2_ppm=…)` by the match + read endpoints. Raised from the R
  method-of-record's 1500 so genuine high-flux rises (manure, active soils) aren't
  clipped; lower it per-install for the strict R cut.

The `flux/` package is the scientific core (pure, **never LLM-touched**):
`regression.py` (`fit_slope` via `scipy.stats.linregress`), `flux.py`
(`compute_flux` → the `FluxLadder`, closed-chamber formula `F = dC/dt · P·V/(R·T·A)`,
CH₄ ppb→ppm, CO₂-equivalent via GWP), `pipeline.py` (`fit_spot`: window
start+30 s→+5 min 30 s, nan drop/count, `low_r2`/`short_window` flags), and
`constants.py` (gas constants, molar masses, GWP, thresholds — the tunable numbers).
**Fit window:** `fit_spot` no longer uses a fixed offset — it **slides a
`FIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` window and picks the most-linear position** (max CO₂ R², ties
broken toward `FIT_SKIP_SECONDS` so clean spots are unchanged). The search is
**centred on the recorded start** (the `anchor_ts` passed by the API): it looks from
`FIT_SEARCH_BACK_SECONDS` *before* to `FIT_SEARCH_MAX_OFFSET_SECONDS` *after* it, so
it can reach an **earlier** slope when the hand-recorded start is late or the
instrument clock runs ahead — the main cause of spuriously low R². This needs the
matcher's lead margin (below); the reported `fit_offset_s` is relative to the
recorded start and may be **negative** (window sits earlier). The same window is
applied to both gases and the chosen offset is logged + shown. (With no anchor —
the pre-lead-margin path — offsets are measured from the first reading, unchanged.)
**Auto window-shortening:** when the best 5-min window is still below
`LOW_R2_THRESHOLD`, `fit_spot` may **shorten** it (keeping its best position) down
to `FIT_SHORTEN_MIN_SECONDS` (4 min) in `FIT_SHORTEN_STEP_SECONDS` steps, adopting a
shorter length only if it lifts R² by `FIT_SHORTEN_MIN_GAIN`. A clean spot is never
shortened; a shortened one reports `window_shortened=True`/`fit_window_s` and is
noted in the log.
**Despike:** `fit_spot` first drops **isolated single-point spikes** (`_despike_mask`
— a lone value off both agreeing neighbours by > `DESPIKE_K` × the robust step
scale; runs are never cut), counted per gas as `n_spikes` (separate from `nan`
gaps) and logged. `parse_li7810` also drops (nan) **both gases on rows the
instrument itself marks INVALID** — a `DIAG` status bit ≥ 32 ("red" codes per
LI-COR's manual Table 2-2: spectral-fit residual too high, unregulated
pressures/temperatures, inlet clogged, not ready). "Yellow" `DIAG` codes
(1–16: frequency/laser-temperature adjustment, incomplete scan, start-up) mean
*noisy but valid* and are **kept** — dropping them lost whole spots on real
campaigns. Noise on kept rows is handled **per gas** by plausibility ranges:
CO₂ in [`MIN_VALID_CO2_PPM`, `max_co2_ppm`) = [0, **5000**) ppm by default (upper
bound configurable via `settings.max_valid_co2_ppm`; was 1500 in the R method,
raised so high-flux rises aren't clipped; negative CO₂ is physically impossible)
and CH₄ in
[`MIN_VALID_CH4_PPB`, `MAX_VALID_CH4_PPB`) = [0, 100 000) ppb (ambient ~2 000,
real chamber rises peak in the tens of thousands; laser mode-hop artefacts
cluster from ~130k up) — an implausible value nulls only that gas.
**Whole-recording mode:** `fit_spot(..., mode="full")` skips the window search and
fits the entire recorded span as-is (despiking still applies) — surfaced via the
`fit_mode=full` query param on the **results, timeseries, and spot-detail**
endpoints (the frontend Results page drives all three from one "Block auto-fit"
switch).
**Manual per-spot offset + crop:** `fit_spot(..., manual_offset_s=…,
manual_end_offset_s=…)` places a window starting `manual_offset_s` seconds from the
recorded start (**positive = later, negative = earlier**) and **overrides**
auto/full. With no `manual_end_offset_s` it keeps the default `FIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`
length (a plain shift never truncates the measurement, given the lead margin); with
`manual_end_offset_s` set it **crops the far edge too** (both ends hand-picked, for
spots disturbed at both ends). A malformed end (`<= ` start) falls back to the
default length. The saved correction (`Spot.manual_offset_s` +
`manual_end_offset_s`) is set/cleared via `PUT …/spots/{nr}/fit`, which rewrites the
spot's `FluxResult` so results + export follow.
**Validation:** the ladder is locked by hand-computed values in `tests/test_flux.py`.
`reference/flux_reference.R` exists but is a **Python-derived scaffold** (so it can't
independently validate yet) — `# TODO: re-validate` once the real, independent R
script replaces it and is run on the 2026-07-02 Kampinos campaign.

The `matching/` package is pure: `timeshift.py` (`apply_offset` adds the
instrument-clock offset to the concentration timestamps) and `match.py`
(`slice_spot` windows the offset-corrected stream by a note's `HH:MM:SS` — or
`HH:MM`, seconds default to 0 — on the
work date; `nearest_temperature`/`nearest_pressure`; `match_spot` returns the
annotated in-window readings, the per-spot temp/pressure, skip reasons — empty
window / stop-before-start / unparseable time — the `no_pressure` flag, and
structured `LogMessage`s). **`match_spot` slices a window with a
`FIT_SEARCH_BACK_SECONDS` lead *before* the recorded start** (plus the forward
`_SLICE_SECONDS = FIT_WINDOW + FIT_SEARCH_MAX_OFFSET`), so the stored `Reading`
rows include data on both sides of the recorded start — the raw material the fit
step's backward search and the user's backward manual shift need. Spots are matched
independently, so a shared GPS (light/dark pair or redo) stays distinct. **Note:**
analyses matched before the lead margin existed store no pre-start data — re-run the
match to shift a spot earlier.

Persistence lives in `app/db/`: `models.py` (SQLModel tables), `session.py` (the
engine, `get_session` dependency, and `create_db_and_tables`, called from the
startup lifespan in `main.py`), and `storage.py` (raw-file storage helpers). Raw
uploaded files are kept on disk under **`data/<analysis_id>/<role>.<ext>`** where
`role` is one of `concentration | notes | temperature | pressure` (original
extension preserved), so any campaign can be re-run. `DATA_DIR` sets the base dir
(default `./data`, created on startup); the SQLite DB defaults to `data/flux.db`
(`DATABASE_URL`).

## Database schema
SQLite via SQLModel, **five tables**. Primary keys are URL-safe UUID4 hex strings.
Columns mirror `project-brief.md` → "Data stored by the application" (with an added
`status` on `Analysis` and a `ProcessingLogEntry` table for the persisted log).

- **`Analysis`** `(id, name, work_date, chamber_area_m2, chamber_volume_l,
  time_offset_seconds, status, created_at)` — `status` is
  `draft | needs_review | complete`.
- **`Spot`** `(id, analysis_id, nr, gps, light_dark, location_desc, start_time,
  stop_time, manual_offset_s, manual_end_offset_s)` — `start_time`/`stop_time` are
  `HH:MM:SS` strings (`PUT …/notes` normalises hand-edited times, e.g. `9:41` →
  `09:41:00`; a malformed time is stored as `""` and skips just that spot at match
  time); `manual_offset_s` (nullable) is the saved manual fit-window start override
  and `manual_end_offset_s` (nullable) the optional hand-picked window END (crop) —
  both None = automatic. Added after initial release, so `create_db_and_tables` runs
  tiny idempotent `ADD COLUMN` migrations (`session.py:_run_lightweight_migrations`)
  for
  DBs created before it existed.
- **`Reading`** `(id, spot_id, timestamp, co2_ppm, ch4_ppb, temperature_used,
  pressure_used)` — concentrations are nullable (`nan` rows stored as null).
- **`FluxResult`** `(id, spot_id, gas, slope, r2, flux_umol_m2_s, flux_umol_m2_h,
  flux_mol_m2_h, flux_gC_m2_day, flux_kg_m2_h, flux_kg_ha_h, flux_kg_ha_day,
  flux_kg_ha_year, flux_Mg_ha_year, flux_Mg_ha_year_co2equiv, n_points)`
- **`ProcessingLogEntry`** `(id, analysis_id, ts, severity, message)` — `severity`
  is `info | warning | error`.

Relationships: `Analysis` → many `Spot` and `ProcessingLogEntry`; `Spot` → many
`Reading` and `FluxResult`.

## How to add an endpoint (the recipe)
1. **Write the test first** in `backend/tests/` (mirror the `app/` path); assert the
   route, status, and response shape — watch it fail.
2. **Define the schemas** (request + response) in `app/schemas/`.
3. **Put the real work in a pure module** (`parsing/` / `matching/` / `flux/` /
   `db/`) as functions with no FastAPI imports — easy to unit-test in isolation.
4. **Add/extend a router** in `app/api/`: thin handler that validates input, calls
   the pure logic, returns a schema.
5. **Wire it** into `app/main.py` (`app.include_router(...)`), keeping the `/api`
   prefix.
6. **Green up:** `pytest`, `ruff check . && ruff format --check .`, `mypy .`.
7. **Update the docs in the same commit** (see the update rule below).

## Observability (logging + monitoring)
Structured JSON logging (`core/logging.py`) with a per-request correlation id
(`X-Request-ID`, `core/middleware.py`) and secret redaction; levels via
`LOG_LEVEL`. **Error/performance monitoring is optional Sentry** (`core/monitoring.py`,
`sentry-sdk[fastapi]`): **off unless `SENTRY_DSN` is set** — the app must always
start/run without it. When on, it auto-captures unhandled exceptions (→5xx),
stamps the same `request_id` on every event (so an issue links to the logs), and
redacts sensitive values with the logger's key list. Env: `SENTRY_DSN`,
`SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE` (git SHA), `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`. See
`../docs/operations.md` (logging) and `../report.md` (monitoring, alert rules).

## Deferred features (the app must run fully without either)
- **LLM field-notes/pressure parser** (`app/llm/`) — **TODO: seminar 6.** Until then
  the notes/pressure are hand-editable; `LLM_API_KEY` in `.env` is a placeholder and
  stays blank. Nothing downstream may hard-depend on the LLM being configured.
- **n8n quality-check workflow** — **TODO: later seminar.** Results always compute
  and display without it; a missing quality check is a note on the results, never a
  failure.

## The update rule
**When you add a feature, add or change an endpoint, or change the
structure/commands, update this file (and the root `../CLAUDE.md` if the cross-app
picture changed) in the same commit.** Keep the API structure, DB schema, layout,
and commands here true to the code. Docs drift is a bug.
